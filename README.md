# Obsidian Jira Cloud Plugin

Connect your Jira issues to Obsidian. Search for issues and add them to frontmatter or use them in templates without leaving Obsidian. See the [project roadmap](https://github.com/users/OfficerHalf/projects/5) for details on the future of the plugin.

## Documentation

Check out the complete [documentation](https://pages.nathan-smith.org/obsidian-jira-cloud/) to start using [Jira Cloud](https://github.com/OfficerHalf/obsidian-jira-cloud).

## Disclaimers

This plugin is open source software not created or endorsed in any way by Atlassian. It also makes use of other open source libraries, mainly [Jira.js](https://github.com/MrRefactoring/jira.js), which is similarly not created or endorsed by Atlassian.

Use of this plugin requires the creation of an API Token which grants full read and write access to the configured Jira instance; though it can be revoked at any time, anything your Jira account can do, this token can do. Use at your own risk.

## Alternatives

There is a fair amount of overlap between this plugin and [Obsidian Jira Issue](https://github.com/marc0l92/obsidian-jira-issue), developed by [marc0l92](https://github.com/marc0l92). That plugin prioritizes live views of issues, while this one is more focused on static content. Be sure to check that plugin out, it might be better for your use case! I'm exploring the overlap between the two plugins in [this issue](https://github.com/OfficerHalf/obsidian-jira-cloud/issues/22).
